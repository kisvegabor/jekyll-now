# Drop down list (lv_ddlist)

## Overview

Drop Down Lists allow you to simply select one option from more. The Drop Down List is closed by default an show the currently selected text. If you click on it the list opens and all the options are shown.

### Set options
The options are passed to the Drop Down List as a string with `lv_ddlist_set_options(ddlist, options)`. The options should be separated by `\n`. For example: `"First\nSecond\nThird"`.

You can select an option manually with `lv_ddlist_set_selected(ddlist, id)`, where _id_ is the index of an option.

### Get selected option
The get the currently selected option use `lv_ddlist_get_selected(ddlist)` it will return the *index* of the selected option.

`lv_ddlist_get_selected_str(ddlist, buf, buf_size)` copies the name of the selected option to `buf`.

### Align the options
To align the label horizontally use `lv_ddlist_set_align(ddlist, LV_LABEL_ALIGN_LEFT/CENTER/RIGHT)`.

### Height and width
By default, the list's height is adjusted automatically to show all options. The `lv_ddlist_set_fix_height(ddlist, height)` sets a fixed height for the opened list. `0` means to use auto height.

The width is also adjusted automatically. To prevent this apply `lv_ddlist_set_fix_width(ddlist, width)`. `0` means to use auto width.

### Scrollbars
Similarly to [Page](/object-types/page) with fix height the Drop Down List supports various scrollbar display modes. It can be set by `lv_ddlist_set_sb_mode(ddlist, LV_SB_MODE_...)`.

### Animation time
The Drop Down List open/close animation time is adjusted by `lv_ddlist_set_anim_time(ddlist, anim_time)`. Zero animation time means no animation.

### Decoration arrow
A down arrow can be added to the left side of the Drop down list with `lv_ddlist_set_draw_arrow(ddlist, true)`.

### Stay open
You can force the Drop down list to **stay opened** when an option is selected with `lv_ddlist_set_stay_open(ddlist, true)`.
