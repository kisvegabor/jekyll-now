## Get the library

The Littlev Graphics Library is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/littlevgl/lvgl](https://github.com/littlevgl/lvgl). 
You can clone or download the latest version of the library from here or you can use the [Download](https://littlevgl.com/download) page as well. 

The graphics library is the **lvgl** directory which should be copied into your project.

## Config file

There is a configuration header file for LittlevGL called **lv_conf.h**. It sets the library's basic behavior, disable unused modules and features, adjust the size of memory buffers in compile time.
 
Copy **lvgl/lv_conf_template.h** next to the *lvgl* directory and rename it to *lv_conf.h*. Open the file and change the `#if 0` at the beginning to `#if 1` to enable its content. 

In the config file comments explain the meaning of the options. Check at least these three config options and modify them according to your hardware:
1. **LV_HOR_RES_MAX** Your display's horizontal resolution
2. **LV_VER_RES_MAX** Your display's vertical resolution
3. **LV_COLOR_DEPTH** 8 for (RG332), 16 for (RGB565) or 32 for (RGB888 and ARGB8888). 

## Initialization

In order to use the graphics library you have to initialize it and the other components too. To order of the initialization is:

1. Call *lv_init()*
2. Initialize your drivers
3. Register the display and input devices drivers in LittlevGL. (see below) 
4. Call `lv_tick_inc(x)` in every `x` milliseconds in an interrupt to tell the elapsed time. (see below)
5. Call `lv_task_handler()` periodically in every few milliseconds to handle LittlevGL realted tasks. (see below)
