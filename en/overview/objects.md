# Objects

In the Littlev Graphics Library the **basic building blocks** of a user interface are the objects. For example:

- [Button](/Button)
- [Label](/Label)
- [Image](/Image)
- [List](/List)
- [Chart](/Chart)
- [Text area](/Text-area)

## Object attributes

### Basic attributes

The objects have basic attributes which are common independently from their type:

- Position
- Size
- Parent
- Drag enable
- Click enable etc.

You can set/get this attributes with `lv_obj_set_...` and `lv_obj_get_...` functions. For example:

```c
/*Set basic object attributes*/
lv_obj_set_size(btn1, 100, 50);	  /*Button size*/
lv_obj_set_pos(btn1, 20,30);      /*Button position*/
```

To see all the available functions visit the Base object's [documentation](/Base-object).

### Specific attributes

The object types have special attributes. For example a slider have:

- Min. max. values
- Current value
- Custom styles

For these attributes every object type have unique API functions. For example for a slider: 

```c
/*Set slider specific attributes*/
lv_slider_set_range(slider1, 0, 100);			    /*Set min. and max. values*/
lv_slider_set_value(slider1, 40, LV_ANIM_ON);	/*Set the current value (position)*/
lv_slider_set_action(slider1, my_action);     /*Set a callback function*/
```

## Object's working mechanisms

### Parent-child structure

A parent object can be considered as the container of its children. Every object has exactly one parent object (except screens) but a parent can have unlimited number of children. 
There is no limitation for the type of the parent but there typically parent (e.g. button) and typical child (e.g. label) objects.

### Moving together

If the position of the parent is changed the children will move with the parent. 
Therefore all positions are relative to the parent. 
So the (0;0) coordinates mean the objects will remain in the top left-hand corner of the parent independently from the position of the parent.

```c
lv_obj_t * par = lv_obj_create(lv_scr_act(), NULL); 	/*Create a parent object on the current screen*/
lv_obj_set_size(par, 100, 80);		                    /*Set the size of the parent*/

lv_obj_t * obj1 = lv_obj_create(par, NULL);	          /*Create an object on the previously created parent object*/
lv_obj_set_pos(obj1, 10, 10);			                    /*Set the position of the new object*/
```

Modify the position of the parent:
  
![](https://littlevgl.com/docs/par_child2.png "Graphical objects are moving togother 2")  

```c
lv_obj_set_pos(par, 50, 50);		/*Move the parent. The child will move with it.*/
```

### Visibility only on parent

If a child partially or fully out of its parent then the parts outside will not be visible.
  
![](https://littlevgl.com/docs/par_child3.png "A graphical object is visible on its parent")  

```c
lv_obj_set_x(obj1, -30);		/*Move the child a little bit of the parent*/
```

### Create - delete objects

In LittlevGL objects can be created and deleted dynamically in run-time. 
It means only the currently created objects consume RAM. 
For example, if you need a chart you can create it only when it is required and delete after it is used.

Every objects type has its own **create** function with an unified prototype. 
It needs two parameters: a pointer the parent object and optionally a pointer to an other object with the same type to copy it. 
To create a screen give *NULL* as parent. 
The second parameter can be *NULL* to not copy an other obejct.
 
Independently from the object type a common variable type **lv_obj_t** is used. This pointer can be used later to set or get the attributes of the object. 

The create functions look like this:

```c
lv_obj_t * lv_type_create(lv_obj_t * parent, lv_obj_t * copy);
```

There is a common **delete** function for all object types. It deletes the object and all of its children.

```c
void lv_obj_del(lv_obj_t * obj);
```

You can delete only the children of an object but leave the object itself "alive":

```c
void lv_obj_clean(lv_obj_t * obj);
```


### Screen â€“ the most basic parent

The screen is a special object which has no parent object. So it is craeted like:
```c
lv_obj_t * scr1 = lv_obj_create(NULL, NULL);
```


Always there is an active screen. By default, the library creates and loads one.  
To get the currently active screen use the `lv_scr_act()` function to load new one use `lv_scr_load(scr1)`.

A screen can be created with any object type, for example, a basic object or an image to make a wallpaper.


Screens are created on the *deafult display*. 
The *deafult screen* is the lastly registered screen with `lv_disp_drv_register` (if there is only screen then that one) or explicitly selected display with `lv_disp_set_default`. 
`lv_scr_act()` and `lv_scr_load()` operate on the currently default screen.
